# Infinity Influencer Marketing

# Project Description


* Build a Python microservice to identify whether a given post_text is sponsored or not.
* post_text is a english language text which may contain emoji (e.g ðŸ˜€) or special
  characters
* To determine whether a post_text is sponsored or not we would like to use the following
  logic:
  * If below keywords are present in the post_text, we say that post_text is a
    sponsored post
  * Non-sponsored otherwise
* We should be able to add new keywords to the original set of keywords so that our vocabulary is not static.
